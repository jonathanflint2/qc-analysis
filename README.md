Code for quantitative complementation paper
This repository contains code written to process genotypes and phenotypes in mouse inbred mapping experiments. The heavy lifting is done by GEMMA (for mapping using mixed models) and METASOFT (for the meta-analysis). There is also a small amount of R code to carry out the complementation testing from inbred strain data. Details on the methods are given in our paper:
